# Brass Fingering Deluxe

This plugins was made to make easier to add fingering to brass instruments in Musescore 3 and 4. It supports trumpets in C and Bb, trombone, tuba and euphonium. It's also possible to add fingering for other instruments by using the `Note shift` option, that allows you to shift the fingering to any tone in the scale.

When the `Auto` option is selected the plugin will try to add fingering to all the staffs, based on the instrument name. When `Auto` is checked the `Clean fingering` button will also act in all staffs.

The `Break line` option makes the plugin add the fingering numbers one per line for trumpet, tuba and euphonium. When not selected the numbers will be placed side by side.
